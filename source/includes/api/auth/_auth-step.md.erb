## Auth MFA

> Example Request (Question Based MFA)

```shell
curl "<%= config.host %>/auth" \
  -H "<%= config.auth %>" \
  -d '{
    "mfa": [{
      "answer": "Secret Answer",
      "identifier": "Bk0zwVx1Z"
    }],
    "token": "56e1dbb5443b10a3bd403fcf"
  }'
```

> Example Request (Code Based MFA)

```shell
curl "<%= config.host %>/auth" \
  -H "<%= config.auth %>" \
  -d '{
    "mfa": { 
      "identifier": "ByDXD4eJW" 
    },
    "token": "56e1dbb5443b10a3bd403fcf"
  }'
```

Some companies require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and the `/auth/step` route is built to submit the additional information needed. Users are first submitted via the standard authenticate process via the `/auth` endpoint, and the MFA data is sent through an additional request to the `/auth/step` route.

For `questions` (Question Based MFA) return the answers formatted as an array of objects, where each object includes the `answer` of the question and the `identifier` received from the previous `auth` response. For `code` (Code Based MFA) return the desired option by passing the `identifier` field given to you from the previous `auth` response. Continue to POST to the `/auth/step` with the required answers until a `200` status code is returned. At that point the user will be authenticated and you'll have access to available [items]('#auth-items')
