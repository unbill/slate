Connect is a drop-in module that provides a secure, elegant authentication flow for each company that the <%= config.apiName %> supports. Connect makes it secure and easy for [clients](#client) to link their accounts, while doing the heavy lifting for the authentication.

[View demo](https://connect.q2open.io)

### Events

Connect will emit events back to your app using the browser [postMessage](<%= config.iFramePostMessage %>) API, [WKScriptMessageHandler](<%= config.iosPostMessage %>) on iOS, or [addJavascriptInterface](<%= config.androidPostMessage %>) on Android, allowing you to decide what to do after the user is finished.

Event | Description
----- | -----------
`auth` | The user successfully authenticated with a company.
`exit` | The user exited the module without completing an authentication.
`alive` | Emitted every 30 seconds to indicate that the user is not idle.

### userPresenceRequired

If the company requires that the user is present to pass through any security flows with every login,
as indicated by the `company.userPresenceRequired` flag, there are a number of constraints to consider when designing your user experience:

- Bill data cannot be updated ad-hoc without the user first passing through security.
- Payments must be completed in real-time (not scheduled) since the user must be present.
- Likewise, Swaps must also be completed in real-time with the user present.

Instead of calling the typical API routes, you'll need to open Connect to perform these actions immediately after a successful authentication. The user won't need
 to re-enter their username and password, but may need to step through security. Using the `authId`, `billId`, `items`, and `paymentMethodId` URL parameters as
 documented below, you'll be able to make payments and swaps in real-time, while allowing users the liberty of maintaining their approach to account security.

### URL parameters

The following URL parameters can be optionally passed into the Connect URL to customize the experience.

Parameter | Description
----- | -----------
`companyId` | Deeplink to a specific `companyId`, skipping the search screen.
`swapId` | Can be used in conjunction with `paymentMethodId` to move a swap to a different payment method.
`billId` | Can be used in conjunction with `paymentMethodId` to make a payment when `company.userPresenceRequired` is `true`.
`cardPaymentsOnly` | Limit searches to companies that support card-based payments.
`items` | Indicates the next desired action once an authentication is successful. Set to `swap` to automatically create a [Swap](#swap). Set to `bill` to update bill data. Set to `payment` (in conjuction with a billId) to make a real-time payment towards the balance.
`paymentMethodId` | Sets a previously added payment method to be used for a `swap` or `payment` once an authentication is successful.

### URL Examples

To authenticate with a company:

`https://connect.q2open.io?token=123&companyId=123&items=bill`

To make a payment when `company.userPresenceRequired` is `true`:

`https://connect.q2open.io?token=123&billId=123&paymentMethodId=123&items=payment`

To initiate a new swap:

`https://connect.q2open.io?token=123&companyId=123&paymentMethodId=123&items=swap`

To move a swap to a different payment method:

`https://connect.q2open.io?token=123&swapId=123&paymentMethodId=123&items=swap`
