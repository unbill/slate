# Products

Our white-label products are the fastest way to implement our API's functionality with a design that fits your branding. We've built a set of products that key in on common use cases of our API. These products include [Connect](#connect), [CardSwap](#cardswap) and [Biller Direct](#biller-direct).

## WebView Integration

Integration with our products is straightforward.

1. Create a one-time use token by making a call to the `/client/create-token` endpoint.
2. SSO into the white-label product by passing in the token as a URL parameter. An example URL would look like this: `https://product.q2open.io?token=123`.

## Example Code

See our [integration examples](https://github.com/unbill/integration-examples) for an example implementation in Swift and React Native.
