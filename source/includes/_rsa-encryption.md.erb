## Message Security
### RSA/AES Encryption
> Example Encrypted Request

```json
{
  "encrypted": "EXAMPLE",
  "hash": "PQ5+gSzli4DyOzXUYqT74QIZ9l4VIyWJipb521HfUnwwj0sNPp0ASyodxb3YOmhbM6nZ+bFXkPN1u2vcXo80yYcMy0xXmfcQ27LRsVjD8kLw7PC0LSfKh1ZHvx+xpxnHDDOYwqRMVFUHIz6ggxPJB39f7hZXRvp5JQQhnB/3JfpV/UvmXjhdQlgC50yOOIJ12S36cnncBrwqYvvDV7iY8Uq6x2ddZRl/2GNoUpnf9jIoKEqeNEpuqoD9g6cwcXXgbjyObxfl6zOSQlfgHJye/Me7E0d+4r0/OWhnSYC6GgedAwUM1fBVGAkAqQKEtU2BYD1kIP8hBSMJxWzVjqKn0A=="
}
```

Optionally, message encryption may be used when making a `POST` request to the API.

- Message encryption uses a combination of AES and RSA encryption.
  - The message payload is encrypted using AES-CTR-256.
  - The resultant AES key is then encrypted using an RSA 2048-bit public key.
- An RSA key-pair can be created in the `Settings` area of the Nexus application and the public key can be copied.
  - The public key is provided in PCKS #8 format.
- The [examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/unbill/examples) includes an example of encrypting the payload with your public key using a combination of AES and RSA encryption.
- Use the API routes as documented, however your payload will be encrypted and base64 encoded using the public key, and sent in a `hash` parameter.
- Add an `encrypted` parameter to your request with the key identifer which is created when you generate an RSA key in Nexus.

### RSA Signing
> Example Signed Request

```shell
curl "<%= config.host %>/client/create-token" \
  -H "<%= config.auth %>" \
  -H "Signature: MzfMtn6M9rpHyzGSvBPkzbNZlne+rf3tkcLUeMUW8mOMmdP1VtnnVdQA9hdYVObjwibOGdRQmCeoI9Xba5DXGT2/l9wOSJQ4FI90DssY1l+orOiwVwY8quAgBUYd2YDDUGyEJ31Y9yOgwLBp2xC4pA5vfkYtWAC9PccdxDyMZcCm6pz3AVgfCRN1m2rcZsE/VrhWhZof3sYitP3zTfV7KCF3T232HPHQtEYtEMLE4Pi7t4i+KvR4Rejt4a7DIgba3OfVmWf5La7WzdlU4eneIPnVjk3CGUo4t9PIPJQVbLyDSIXiF9pRD8ZlW+19XUe/HyWFHR4em00nbaNjBG4TSQ==" \
  -H "Date: 2019-09-17T14:14:24.874Z" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifier": "5b2bd638bdf6035960b98694"
  }'
  -X POST
```

Optionally, 2048-bit Asymmetric request signing may be used when making requests to the API.

- Create a public/private key pair following PKCS #1/sha-256 signing scheme.
- Provide the public key to Q2 or update the request signing public key in the Q2 Nexus portal.
- With each request to the API, generate a signature using the following formula:
  - Request method in all uppercase: `POST/PUT/GET/DELETE` plus a colon.
  - Path and query of the request plus a colon.
  - Your API Key plus a colon.
  - The current date and time in ISO format
  - Example: `POST:/v1/client/create-token:YOUR_API_KEY:2019-09-17T14:14:24.874Z`
- Use an RSA signing library to create an RSA signature from the signature text with the pkcs1-sha256 signing scheme.
- Encode the produced signature as a Base64 string.
- Add the Base64 signature in the `Signature` header of the request.
- Add the date that was included in the signature to the `Date` header of the request.

When request signing is enabled, a signature must be provided with every API request.
If the signature is not provided, a `401-Unauthorized` response will result.
