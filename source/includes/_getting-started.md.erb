> Example Request

```shell
curl "<%= config.host %>/auth" \
  -H "<%= config.auth %>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clientId": "566595c8ce88ccec69328566",
    "companyId": "56e1dbb5443b10a3bd403fcf",
    "form": {
      "username": "Johnny",
      "password": "Appleseed"
    }
  }'
```

To authenticate bills with your users, you may use the following flow.

### User Creation

1. User signs up in your app.
2. Make a request to the `/client` endpoint to retrieve a `clientId` to store in your database for future requests.

### Authentication

1. Search for the company you'd like to add from the `/company/search` endpoint.
2. Provide your user with a "bill authentication" view populated with the login fields retrieved from the desired company.
3. Have your user fill out their credentials, and then send those credentials to the `/auth` endpoint.
4. <%= config.brand %> will begin the authentication process and respond with [events](#event).

### Bills

1. Requests can be made to the `/bill/list/{clientId}` endpoint to retrieve the list of authenticated bills and balance information.
2. Requests can be made to the `/bill/{billId}` endpoint to retrieve details on a specific bill.

### Payments

1. Provide your user with a "link payment" view to choose a payment method.
2. Link this payment method using the `/payment` endpoint.
3. By default, bills will be paid automatically by using the payment method on file.
4. To change this, you must make a request to the `/payment/settings` endpoint to disable recurring payments.
5. When recurring payments are disabled, in order to make an on-demand payment, one must be scheduled via the `/payment/schedule` endpoint.
6. You can cancel a scheduled payment for a bill by using the `/payment/cancel` endpoint.
