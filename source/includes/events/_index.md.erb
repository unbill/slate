# Events

Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens on behalf of your users.
When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a new bill is received, we create a `bill.update` event; when a bill payment is sent, we create a `bill.payment` event.

We have a system for sending the event objects directly to an endpoint on your server, called [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook). Webhooks are managed in Nexus.
