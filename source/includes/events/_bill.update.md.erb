When a bill's outstanding balance changes. Note that the `payload.data.previous` value may not always be available. For instance, when the system first aggregates bill data, the previous bill balance may not have been known. Also note that when the `payload.data.previous.balance` is `0.00` and there is a new current balance, this means that a new bill was issued by the company's system.
